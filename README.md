# 💫 About Me:
I'm a Computing Engineering student based in Guadalajara, México, graduating in June 2026. I've been building and maintaining internal web platforms and management systems full stack, from database design and backend logic to the interfaces people actually use every day. My day-to-day involves turning real user needs into functional, maintainable software, and I genuinely enjoy that process of going from a messy problem to a working solution.<br>I care a lot about writing clean, structured code and building systems that actually hold up when people use them. I'm also interested in cybersecurity, especially on the application side, since understanding how things break is part of understanding how to build them well.<br>Always open to collaborating on interesting projects, especially anything involving backend architecture, internal tooling, web platforms built to solve real problems, or the intersection of development and security.
